## Virtual Bunny Adoption Center

> This *Virtual Bunny Adoption Centre* application allows users to create a profile to browse and choose from a 
> selection of bunnies to adopt, as well as being able to view previously adopted bunnies!

**The application is useful for:**
   - people who are interested in adopting a bunny 
   - also a useful tool for adoption organizations that need a structured and organized way to put 
their bunnies up for adoption.  

Personally, I think bunnies are one of my favourite animals and after hearing about a local rabbit culling near the 
Vancouver International Airport, I was inspired to create this project to show appreciation for these cute animals and 
implement working code that enhances the process of animal adoption.
